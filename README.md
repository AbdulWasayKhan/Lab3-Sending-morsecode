# Lab3-Sending-morsecode

This lab involves writing code that reads in (from the keyboard) a line of
text and outputting that text as Morse code through a blinking LED. This
lab thus involves a couple of different technical components
• Controlling a LED under software control. This was mostly covered in
the previous lab but we will augment the code that was done there
slightly.
• Obtaining a line of text and processing it character by character.
• Extracting individual letters in the line of text and obtaining the
necessary pattern of dots and dashes to encode them to blink the LED.
